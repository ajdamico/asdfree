needs_actions_build_status_line: yes

~~~{dataset_introduction}
The principal labor force survey, providing income, poverty, and health insurance coverage estimates.
~~~

table_structure: * One table with one row per sampled household, a second table with one row per family within each sampled household, and a third table with one row per individual within each of those families.

generalizable_population: * A complex sample designed to generalize to the civilian non-institutional population of the US.

publication_period: * Released annually since 1998, linkable to the [Basic Monthly](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-basic.html) releases.

administrative_organization: * Administered jointly by the [US Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/) and the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/).

Four Example Strengths & Limitations:

✔️ [Detailed labor force categorizations](https://www.bls.gov/cps/definitions.htm)

✔️ [Transparent methodological changes](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/about/modernization.html)

❌ [Retirement and investment income undercount](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4025470)

❌ [Informal worker undercount](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/research-department-working-paper/2023/informal-work-and-official-employment-statistics-whats-missing.aspx)

Three Example Findings:

1. [In 2024, 57% of 18 to 24 year olds and 16% of 25 to 34 year olds lived in their parental home](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2024/families-and-living-arrangements.html).

2. [The ratio of working poor to all individuals in the labor force for at least 27 weeks was 4% in 2022](https://www.bls.gov/opub/reports/working-poor/2022/home.htm).

3. [Between 2022 and 2023, the share of children without health coverage rose from 5.4% to 5.8%](https://www.shadac.org/news/cps-asec-2023-national-health-insurance-coverage-estimates).

~~~{download_and_import_block}

Download and unzip the 2025 file:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
options( timeout = 999 )

tf <- tempfile()

this_url <-	"ftp://ftp2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/datasets/2025/march/asecpub25sas.zip"

download.file( this_url , tf , mode = "wb" )

unzipped_files <- unzip( tf , exdir = tempdir() )
```

Import all four files:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(haven)

four_tbl <- lapply( unzipped_files , read_sas )

four_df <- lapply( four_tbl , data.frame )

four_df <- lapply( four_df , function( w ){ names( w ) <- tolower( names( w ) ) ; w } )

household_df <- four_df[[ grep( 'hhpub' , basename( unzipped_files ) ) ]]
family_df <- four_df[[ grep( 'ffpub' , basename( unzipped_files ) ) ]]
person_df <- four_df[[ grep( 'pppub' , basename( unzipped_files ) ) ]]
repwgts_df <- four_df[[ grep( 'repwgt' , basename( unzipped_files ) ) ]]
```

Divide weights:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
household_df[ , 'hsup_wgt' ] <- household_df[ , 'hsup_wgt' ] / 100
family_df[ , 'fsup_wgt' ] <- family_df[ , 'fsup_wgt' ] / 100
for ( j in c( 'marsupwt' , 'a_ernlwt' , 'a_fnlwgt' ) ) person_df[ , j ] <- person_df[ , j ] / 100
```

Merge these four files:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
names( family_df )[ names( family_df ) == 'fh_seq' ] <- 'h_seq'
names( person_df )[ names( person_df ) == 'ph_seq' ] <- 'h_seq'
names( person_df )[ names( person_df ) == 'phf_seq' ] <- 'ffpos'

hh_fm_df <- merge( household_df , family_df )
hh_fm_pr_df <- merge( hh_fm_df , person_df )
chapter_tag_df <- merge( hh_fm_pr_df , repwgts_df )

stopifnot( nrow( chapter_tag_df ) == nrow( person_df ) )
```

## Poverty and Inequality Estimation with `convey` \\ {-}

The R `convey` library estimates measures of income concentration, poverty, inequality, and wellbeing.  [This textbook](https://guilhermejacob.github.io/context/) details the available features.  As a starting point for CHAPTER_TAG users, this code calculates the gini coefficient on complex sample survey data:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(convey)
chapter_tag_design <- convey_prep( chapter_tag_design )

chapter_tag_household_design <- subset( chapter_tag_design , a_exprrp %in% 1:2 )

svygini( ~ htotval , chapter_tag_household_design )
```

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches the count and share of individuals with health insurance in [Table H-01](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/tables/hi/2025/h_01.xlsx):

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
count_covered <- svytotal( ~ as.numeric( cov == 1 ) , chapter_tag_design )

stopifnot( round( coef( count_covered ) , -5 ) == 310000000 )

stopifnot(
	round( coef( count_covered ) - confint( count_covered , level = 0.9 )[1] , -3 ) == 634000
)

share_covered <- svymean( ~ as.numeric( cov == 1 ) , subset( chapter_tag_design , cov > 0 ) )

stopifnot( round( coef( share_covered ) , 3 ) == 0.920 )

stopifnot(
	round( coef( share_covered ) - confint( share_covered , level = 0.9 )[1] , 3 ) == 0.002
)

```
