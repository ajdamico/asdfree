chapter_title: Violence Against Children And Youth Surveys

needs_local_build_status_line: yes

~~~{dataset_introduction}
The global surveillance system to track and monitor the burden of violence against children.
~~~

table_structure: * One table per country with one row per sampled respondent.

generalizable_population: * Nationally representative cross-sectional household surveys of children and youth ages 13–24.

publication_period: * No listed update frequency across the participating nations.

administrative_organization: * Led by the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/) through funding from [PEPFAR](https://www.state.gov/pepfar/), in partnership with [Together for Girls](https://www.togetherforgirls.org/en/partners).

Four Example Strengths & Limitations:

✔️ [Split sample interviews male and female participants in different communities to eliminate risk of harm](https://www.cdc.gov/violence-against-children/php/country-process/index.html)

✔️ [Some PEPFAR recipient nations coordinate voluntary HIV testing with face-to-face interviews](https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-057124)

❌ [Must balance standardization of procedures and protocols and adaptation for culture and context](https://www.cdc.gov/violence-against-children/media/pdfs/VACS-trainingwhitepaper.pdf)

❌ [Certain sampled households excluded due to cyclones or armed attacks carried out by terrorists](https://www.togetherforgirls.org/en/resources/mozambique-vacs-report-2022)

Three Example Findings:

1. [Kenya observed significant declines in the prevalence of lifetime violence and some risk factors for violence and HIV, and improvements in some service seeking indicators between 2010 and 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00457-5).

2. [In 2015, 49% of 13-24 year old Ugandan females reported any lifetime history of sexual violence](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0260986).

3. [Over 2015-2016, 22% of Rwandan males age 13-17 reported physical violence in the past year](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-022-14815-0).

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches statistics and confidence intervals within 0.1% from the Final Report of the [Mozambique Violence Against Children and Youth Survey (VACS), 2019](https://files.mutualcdn.com/tfg/assets/files/Mozambique-VACS-report.pdf), `Table 4.1.1. Prevalence of different types of sexual violence[1] before age 18, among 18-24-year-olds`:


```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
females_18_to_24_design <- subset( chapter_tag_design , sex == 'female' & agegrp == '18-24' )

# define a function to check unweighted N, prevalence, confidence interval for each estimate
check_sv <- 
	function( this_variable , this_design = females_18_to_24_design , N , prevalence , lb , ub ){
	
		this_formula <- as.formula( paste( "~ as.numeric(" , this_variable , "== 1 )" ) )
	
		stopifnot( coef( unwtd.count( this_formula , this_design ) ) == N )
