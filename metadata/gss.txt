Four Example Strengths & Limitations:

✔️ [Fifty years of comparable measures for trend analyses](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-121919-054838)

✔️ [Fifteen minutes of questionnaire aligns with International Social Survey Programme](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/general-social-survey-competition/nsf24-537/solicitation#pgm_desc_txt)

❌ [One adult per household interviewed, living in larger households lowers probability of selection](https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/documents/standard-projects-pdf/Research%20Highlights-GSS%20(ECON)%20FINAL%20slightly%20different%20layout-DTP%20Formatted.pdf)

❌ [In 2022, 21% of mixed-mode interviews were aged 65+ versus 10% of the web-only oversample](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/methodological-reports/GSS MR138 AmeriSpeak Oversample.pdf#page=5)

Three Example Findings:

1.  [Between 2000 and 2021, confidence in the scientific community has remained steady](https://www.c-span.org/classroom/document/?18739).

2.  [During 2018 to 2021, support for gun control was overwhelmingly positive among survey respondents, differing from sentiment analysis of social media data over the same period](https://gss.norc.org/content/dam/gss/get-documentation/pdf/reports/project-reports/GSS%20Project%20Report%2034%20GSMA.pdf).

3.  [In 2021, 24% of Americans reported they were "not too happy" in life, up from 13% in 2018](https://www.wsj.com/articles/still-feeling-pandemic-miserable-there-are-ways-to-dig-out-11643725802).
