needs_actions_build_status_line: yes -windows -linux



~~~{dataset_introduction}
The nationwide assessment of housing stock, with information on physical condition and neighborhood, costs of financing and maintenance, owner and renter characteristics, and changes over time.
~~~

table_structure: * Nationally-representative and metropolitan flat files with one row per household, plus relational files.

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey of occupied and vacant housing units designed to generalize to all structures in the United States, both nationally and also for about [thirty-five metropolitan areas](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/ahs/tech-documentation/AHS%20Metropolitan%20Area%20Oversample%20Histories%202015%20and%20Beyond.pdf).

publication_period: * Released more or less biennially since 1973, with longitudinal samples redrawn in 1985 and 2015.

administrative_organization: * Sponsored by [the Department of Housing and Urban Development](https://www.hud.gov/), run by the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches the estimate and margin of error of the `Total` row of the `General Housing` tab from the [AHS 2021 Table Specifications and PUF Estimates for User Verification](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/2021/2021%20AHS%20Table%20Specifications%20and%20PUF%20Estimates%20for%20User%20Verification.xlsx):

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
result <- svytotal( ~ as.numeric( intstatus == 1 ) , chapter_tag_design )

stopifnot( round( coef( result ) / 1000 , 0 ) == 128504 )

ci_results <- confint( result , level = 0.9 )

stopifnot( round( ( ci_results[ 2 ] - coef( result ) ) / 1000 , 0 ) == 388 )
```
