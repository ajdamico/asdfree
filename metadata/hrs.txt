chapter_title: Health and Retirement Study

needs_local_build_status_line: yes

~~~{dataset_introduction}
This detailed longitudinal study of the elderly in the United States allows for findings such as, "Among community residents aged 55-64 years old in 1998, what share lived in nursing homes by 2020?"
~~~

table_structure: * Many tables from different timepoints, most with one row per sampled respondent and linkable.

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to Americans aged 50+ at each interview point.

publication_period: * Released biennially since 1992.

administrative_organization: * Administered by the [University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research](http://isr.umich.edu/) with data management by the [RAND Corporation](http://www.rand.org/) and cross-national harmonization by the [University of Southern California](https://g2aging.org/).  Funded by the [National Institute on Aging](https://www.nia.nih.gov/) and the [Social Security Administration](https://www.ssa.gov/).

Four Example Strengths & Limitations:

✔️ [Multiple cohorts allow extended tracking of older individuals across time](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/sites/default/files/biblio/OverviewofHRSPublicData_0.pdf#page=32)

✔️ [Linkable to Medicare, Medicaid, SSA records, also to genetic and biomarker data](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/data-products/restricted-data/available-products)

❌ [Sample size may prevent analysis of smaller populations or rare events](https://hrs.isr.umich.edu/documentation/survey-design/response-rates)

❌ [Attritors may differ in many ways from the general population](https://dx.doi.org/10.7302/24703)

<br>

Three Example Findings:

1. [Among individuals aged 50+ between 2003 and 2016, 80% of those who experienced a long-term care hospital stay subsequently died or suffered a severe impairment within 30 months](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.13309).

2. [Wealth loss of 75%+ was negatively associated with subsequent cognitive function over 2012-2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2666-7568(23)00113-7).

3. [The total monetary cost of dementia in 2010 was between $157 billion and $215 billion](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmsa1204629).

~~~{analysis_examples_survey_design}
This design generalizes to residents of the United States that were living in the community in 1996 (wave 3) and also still alive (and participating in the survey) as of 2020 (wave 15):
```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(survey)

chapter_tag_design <- 
	svydesign(
		id = ~ raehsamp ,
		strata = ~ raestrat ,
		weights = ~ r3wtresp , 
		nest = TRUE ,
		data = subset( chapter_tag_df , r3wtresp > 0 & inw15 == 1 )
	)
```

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches statistics and confidence intervals to four digits from the Gateway to Global Aging's [An Introduction to HRS, RAND HRS Longitudinal File, and Harmonized HRS](https://youtu.be/D409oUPXWUU?t=3201):

1. Navigate to `Contributed Projects` at https://hrsdata.isr.umich.edu/data-products/contributed-projects.

2. Choose `Gateway Harmonized HRS` Latest release: Aug 2023 Version D

3. Download the STATA dataset `H_HRS_d_stata.zip` dated 09/12/2023

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
harmonized_hrs_fn <- file.path( path.expand( "~" ) , "H_HRS_d.dta" )

harmonized_hrs_tbl <- read_dta( harmonized_hrs_fn )

harmonized_hrs_df <- data.frame( harmonized_hrs_tbl )

names( harmonized_hrs_df ) <- tolower( names( harmonized_hrs_df ) )
```


Merge on cluster and strata variables from the RAND HRS Longitudinal file:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }	
harmonized_hrs_rand_df <-
	merge(
		harmonized_hrs_df ,
		chapter_tag_df[ c( 'hhid' , 'pn' , 'raestrat' , 'raehsamp' ) ] ,
		by = c( 'hhid' , 'pn' )
	)

stopifnot( nrow( harmonized_hrs_rand_df ) == nrow( chapter_tag_df ) )
```

Limit the survey design to respondents answering at least two of the five different life satisfaction questions in the 2014 (wave 12) psychosocial leave-behind survey:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
h12sc_df <- subset( harmonized_hrs_rand_df , r12scwtresp > 0 & inw12sc == 1 )

r12sc_design <-
	svydesign(
		~ raehsamp ,
		strata = ~ raestrat ,
		data = h12sc_df ,
		weights = ~ r12scwtresp ,
		nest = TRUE
	)
```

Reproduce the coefficient, standard error, and confidence intervals presented at 53:20 of the tutorial:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
result <- svymean( ~ r12lsatsc , r12sc_design , na.rm = TRUE )

stopifnot( round( coef( result ) , 4 ) == 4.9822 )
stopifnot( round( SE( result ) , 4 ) == 0.0226 )
stopifnot( round( confint( result , df = degf( r12sc_design ) ) , 4 ) == c( 4.9369 , 5.0276 ) )
```
