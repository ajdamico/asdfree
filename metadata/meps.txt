chapter_title: Medical Expenditure Panel Survey


needs_actions_build_status_line: yes

~~~{dataset_introduction}
The Household Component captures person-level spending across service categories, coverage types.
~~~

table_structure: * The consolidated file contains one row per individual within each sampled household, other tables contain one record per event (like prescription fills, hospitalizations), per job, per insurance policy.

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to the U.S. civilian non-institutionalized population.

publication_period: * Released annually since 1996.

administrative_organization: * Administered by the [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality](http://www.ahrq.gov/).

Four Example Strengths & Weaknesses:

✔️ [Detailed information about individual medical events](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/download_data_files_results.jsp?cboDataYear=All&cboDataTypeY=2%2CHousehold+Event+File&buttonYearandDataType=Search&cboPufNumber=All)

✔️ [Detailed sources of health expenditures](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/annual_contractor_report/hc_ann_cntrct_methrpt.pdf#page=68)

❌ [Methodological changes could make a notable impact on trend analyses for conditions](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/Pub_ProdResults_Details.jsp?pt=Methodology%20Report&opt=2&id=1297)

❌ [Household-reported medical events may be undercounted](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/Pub_ProdResults_Details.jsp?pt=Working%20Paper&opt=2&id=1267)

Three Example Findings:

1. [In 2021, the top 1 percent of the population ranked by their healthcare expenditures accounted for 24.0 percent of total healthcare expenditures among the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population](https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/publications/st556/stat556.shtml).

2. [Compared to those losing a job during the three prior years, nonelderly adults who lost a job during 2014 thru 2016 had a 6% net reduction in loss of health insurance coverage](https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmp2023312).

3. [Americans lose ~$1,500 per year (in 2013 USD) over their life-course due to bad health realizations](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23963).

## Function Definitions {-}



Define a function to download, unzip, and import each sas file:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(haven)

meps_sas_import <-
	function( this_url ){
		
		this_tf <- tempfile()
		
		download.file( this_url , this_tf , mode = 'wb' )
		
		this_tbl <- read_sas( this_tf )

		this_df <- data.frame( this_tbl )
		
		names( this_df ) <- tolower( names( this_df ) )
		
		this_df
	}

```

~~~{download_and_import_block}


Download and import the 2022 consolidated file and the replicate weights file:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
chapter_tag_cons_df <-
	meps_sas_import( "https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/pufs/h243/h243v9.zip" )

chapter_tag_brr_df <-
	meps_sas_import( "https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_files/pufs/h036brr/h36brr22v9.zip" )
```


Merge the consolidated file with the replicate weights:

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
chapter_tag_df <- merge( chapter_tag_cons_df , chapter_tag_brr_df )

stopifnot( nrow( chapter_tag_df ) == nrow( chapter_tag_cons_df ) )

chapter_tag_df[ , 'one' ] <- 1
```









~~~{analysis_examples_survey_design}
```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(survey)

chapter_tag_design <-
	svrepdesign(
		data = chapter_tag_df ,
		weights = ~ perwt22f ,
		type = "BRR" ,
		combined.weights = FALSE ,
		repweights = "brr[1-9]+" ,
		mse = TRUE
	)
```

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches the statistic and standard error shown under [Analysis of the Total Population](https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/survey_comp/standard_errors.jsp):


```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
library(foreign)

xport_2002_tf <- tempfile()

xport_2002_url <- "https://meps.ahrq.gov/data_files/pufs/h70ssp.zip"

download.file( xport_2002_url , xport_2002_tf , mode = 'wb' )

unzipped_2002_xport <- unzip( xport_2002_tf , exdir = tempdir() )

chapter_tag_2002_df <- read.xport( unzipped_2002_xport )

names( chapter_tag_2002_df ) <- tolower( names( chapter_tag_2002_df ) )

chapter_tag_2002_design <-
	svydesign(
		~ varpsu ,
		strata = ~ varstr ,
		weights = ~ perwt02f ,
		data = chapter_tag_2002_df ,
		nest = TRUE
	)
			
result <- svymean( ~ totexp02 , chapter_tag_2002_design )
stopifnot( round( coef( result ) , 2 ) == 2813.24 )
stopifnot( round( SE( result ) , 2 ) == 58.99 )

```
