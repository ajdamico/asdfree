~~~{dataset_introduction}
The standardized platform to answer time-sensitive questions about emerging and priority health issues.
~~~

table_structure: * One table with one row per [AmeriSpeak](https://amerispeak.norc.org/) or [KnowledgePanel](https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/solutions/public-affairs/knowledgepanel) respondent.

generalizable_population: * A cross-sectional survey generalizing to the noninstitutionalized adult population of the U.S.

publication_period: * Releases expected four times per year.

administrative_organization: * Conducted by the [National Center for Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/) at the [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/).

Four Example Strengths & Limitations:

✔️ [PRICSSA](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/rss/round5/PRICSSA.pdf)

✔️ [First fielding August 2023, six rounds collected and five public use files released before end of 2024](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2024-12-03/html/2024-28320.htm)

❌ [Of 37 health measures evaluated, 9 measures had medium standardized bias, and 1 had high bias](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/rss/round4/quality-profile.pdf#page=16)

❌ [Demographic questions completed prior to participation might lead to some misclassification](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7320e1)

Three Example Findings:


1. [From March 2020 to November 2023, 30.5% of adults with current ADHD filled an rx using telehealth](http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7340a1).

2. [Among adults with chronic pain in 2023, 47% reported currently receiving medical care for their pain](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-024-09271-y).

3. [Among 18-49 year old women who had sex with a male partner and used a birth control method other than sterilization to prevent pregnancy in 2023, 18% changed or stopped their birth control method](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/rss/rss-topics.html).

## Replication Example {-}

This example matches the statistic and confidence intervals from the "Ever uses a portable air cleaner or purifier in home" page of the [Air cleaners and purifiers dashboard](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/rss/round1/air-purifiers.html):

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
result <-
	svymean(
		~ as.numeric( ven_use > 0 ) ,
		subset( chapter_tag_design , ven_use >= 0 )
	)

stopifnot( round( coef( result ) , 3 ) == .379 )

stopifnot( round( confint( result )[1] , 3 ) == 0.366 )

stopifnot( round( confint( result )[2] , 3 ) == 0.393 )
```
