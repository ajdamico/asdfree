chapter_title: Progress in International Reading Literacy Study




~~~{dataset_introduction}
The Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS) tracks the reading competency of fourth graders across about fifty nations.
~~~

table_structure: * A series of tables with one record per school (ACG), per student (ASG), per teacher (ATG), as well as files containing student achievement (ASA), home background (ASH), student-teacher linkage (AST), and within-country scoring reliability (ASR).

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to the fourth-grade student population of participating countries.

publication_period: * Released quinquennially since 2001.

administrative_organization: * Funded by the [International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement](https://www.iea.nl/) and compiled by the [Lynch School of Education at Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/lsoe.html).

## Replication Example {-}

These calculations reproduce the reading proficiency statistics and standard errors displayed in [Appendix 4A PDF pages 10 and 11](https://timssandpirls.bc.edu/publications/pirls/2016-methods/P16_MP_Chap4_Estimating_Standard_Errors.pdf) for both Australia and the United States.

```{r eval = FALSE , results = "hide" }
australia_usa_design <- subset( chapter_tag_design , idcntry %in% c( 36 , 840 ) )

rm( chapter_tag_design ) ; gc()

results <-
	MIcombine( 
		with( 
			australia_usa_design , 
			svyby( 
				~ asrrea , 
				~ idcntry , 
				svymean 
			) 
		) 
	)


stopifnot( round( coef( results )[1] , 2 ) == 544.36 )
stopifnot( round( SE( results )[1] , 2 ) == 2.53 )
stopifnot( round( coef( results )[2] , 2 ) == 549.44 )
stopifnot( round( SE( results )[2] , 2 ) == 3.09 )
