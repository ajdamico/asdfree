~~~{dataset_introduction}
The Survey of Business Owners tracks nearly every tax-filing sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation in the nation.
~~~

table_structure: * One table with one row per firm per state per industry.

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to all firms in the United States, however the public use microdata only includes [classifiable (non-identifiable) firms](https://www2.census.gov/econ/sbo/07/pums/2007_sbo_pums_users_guide.pdf#page=17) which comprise nearly all businesses but only about half of workers.

publication_period: * Released as part of the U.S. Census Bureau's Economic Census, every year ending in 2 or 7.

administrative_organization: * Administered by the [U.S. Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/).
