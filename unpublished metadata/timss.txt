chapter_title: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study




~~~{dataset_introduction}
The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) tracks the math and science competency of fourth graders across about fifty nations.
~~~

table_structure: * A series of tables with one record per school (ACG), per student (ASG), per teacher (ATG), as well as files containing student achievement (ASA), home background (ASH), student-teacher linkage (AST), and within-country scoring reliability (ASR).

generalizable_population: * A complex sample survey designed to generalize to the fourth-grade student population of participating countries.

publication_period: * Released quadrennially since 1995.

administrative_organization: * Funded by the [International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement](https://www.iea.nl/) and compiled by the [Lynch School of Education at Boston College](http://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/lsoe.html).
