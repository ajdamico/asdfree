chapter_title: FDA Adverse Event Reporting System

~~~{dataset_introduction}
The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) compiles all prescription drug-related side-effects reported by either physicians or patients in the United States.  Either party can make a (voluntary) submission to the FDA or the manufacturer (who then must report that event).  This is the post-marketing safety surveillance program for drug and therapeutic biological products.
~~~

table_structure: * Multiple tables linkable by the `primaryid` field with patient demographics, drug/biologic information, patient outcomes, reporting source, drug start and end dates.

publication_period: * Published quarterly with the latest events reported to the FDA since 2004, with a revised system beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012.

administrative_organization: * Maintained by the United States [Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](http://www.fda.gov/).
