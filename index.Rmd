Please ask questions about this book at [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=r+survey) with the `R` and `survey` tags.

This book replaces my archived [blog](http://usgsd.blogspot.com/), prior [code](https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/tree/archive), and the no longer maintained [lodown](http://github.com/ajdamico/lodown) package.

_A work of R is never finished, merely abandoned._
