# Public Microdata, Easy to Type Website {-}

Please ask questions about the content of this book at [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=r+survey) with the `R` and `survey` tags.

The survey microdata presented in this book require the [R survey package](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/) by [Dr. Thomas Lumley](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/t-lumley) at the University of Auckland.  Dr. Lumley wrote [a textbook](http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/svybook/) to showcase that software.

This book replaces my archived [blog](http://usgsd.blogspot.com/), prior [code](https://github.com/ajdamico/asdfree/tree/archive), and the no longer maintained [lodown](http://github.com/ajdamico/lodown) package.

_A work of R is never finished, only abandoned._
